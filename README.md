##The topic we chose 
(1) Which MTA bus routes are highly utilized by CUNY students? For routes that are automated camera-enforced, how have bus speeds changed over time?

Recommendation - Compare a bus route you or someone you know utilizes for campus. Compare this with another campus route and a route that is not ACE enforced.
